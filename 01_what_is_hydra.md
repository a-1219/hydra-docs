# What is Hydra?

Hydra is an open source platform for live coding visuals that works on the browser. Allowing transformations through code writing in real time. 
Inspired by analog modular synthesizers it uses multiple framebuffers to allow dynamically mixing.
 By interconnecting functions, what we do is to add or subtract pixels to generate changes in contrast, brightness, hue, saturation, color and even digital feedback. 

It uses JavaScript as its main language, it can be linked with p5js (JS library for Processing) and also custom shaders, underneath, Hydra runs shaders (low level programming, WEBGL). 
Can also be inserted webcams, videos, images and/or web pages, it allows control parameters via MIDI or OSC.
