# What is Hydra?

Hydra is an analog-synth-like coding environment for creating real-time visuals. The main editor runs directly in the browser and is [open-source](https://). You can simply open the [hydra web editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz) on a laptop or mobile device to get started.

Hydra is written in Javascript and compiles to WebGL under the hood. The language structure is inspired by analog modular synthesis, in which chaining or patching a set of effects (aka functions) together generates a visual result. You can dynamically mix multiple visual sources (such as webcams, videos, screen captures, livestreams, and internal feedback buffers) to generate live visual compositions, as well as to explore feedback loops and pixel glitches.

#### Hydra can be used to: 
- mix and add effects to live sources on the internet such as videos, camera feeds, screenshares, and live streams
- create generative and audio-reactive visuals, and share them online with others
- write code in realtime to create a live performance
- add visual effects to or embed a sketch in your website
- experiment with video feedback, fractals, and pixel operations
- combine hydra with other libraries such as p5.js, three.js, and Tone.js, use hydra as a standalone library
- use MIDI or OSC to control parameters
- extend the libraries by writing your own shaders and adding functions
- live-jam with others online

Hydra has an active community around the world working with art and code, diy internet spaces, live performance, video art, learning and teaching computer programming, and modular synthesis. Feel free to share your work online, or to join the discord or facebook group to connect with others.
